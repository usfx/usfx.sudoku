This is a Cabal project. Use `cabal` to compile the code and run the tests:

```
sudoku$ cabal configure
sudoku$ cabal run test-sudoku
--- output of tests
```

The easiest way to experiment with the code whilst you work on it is 
by running `cabal repl` from the top level of the project:

```
$ cd sudoku 
$ cabal repl
```
